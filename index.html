        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Olasehinde Michael Temidayo, i am a Junior Frontend Developer and also a Crypto enthusiast.
            I had my majors in Estate Management and Valuation with a Distinction.
            I have always loved computers as my first dream was to create a VR Game, but at that time i didn't know what
            VR was but the thought was just to me and there were other features in it as well(Can't really get into
            those details now).
